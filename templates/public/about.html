    <p>
      The <strong>PCM Hub</strong> is a scientific project dedicated to the collection, storage, and analysis of syntactic data from the world's languages.
      Our goal is to provide linguists and researchers with a reliable dataset to study the historical relationships between languages using the <strong>Parametric Comparison Method (PCM)</strong>.

    <h3>Why Syntax?</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional historical linguistics often relies on lexical comparison (words). However, syntax — the abstract rules governing sentence structure — offers a deeper, more stable level of comparison. By analyzing binary parameters (e.g., "Does the adjective precede the noun?"), we can reconstruct phylogenetic trees with high precision, even for ancient divergence times.
